# React Demo and Learning App

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate specific scenarios and functionality.

Note: The index.js uses React.StrictMode to wrap App.js.
This double-invokes all renders and useMemos to make side effects more apparent.
See https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#detecting-unexpected-side-effects for more information.
